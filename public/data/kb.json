    "stepsMarkdown": "## What is a GFCI?\nGFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlets protect against electrical shock. They have TEST and RESET buttons and can trip without flipping the main breaker.\n\n## Reset Procedure\n1. Locate GFCI outlets (usually in kitchen, bathroom, garage)\n2. Look for outlet with TEST/RESET buttons\n3. Press RESET button firmly\n4. You should hear a click\n5. Test outlet with small appliance\n\n## Common GFCI Locations\n- Kitchen countertop outlets\n- Bathroom vanity outlets\n- Garage outlets\n- Outdoor outlets\n\n## Note\nOne GFCI can protect multiple downstream outlets. If bathroom outlet doesn't work, check kitchen GFCI and vice versa.",
